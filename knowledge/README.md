# Knowledge

Domain-specific context. Replace or extend this folder with your project docs while keeping structure.

- Current seed: `homedir/` (product overview + architecture/persistence references).
- To add a new domain: copy `templates/TEMPLATE_KNOWLEDGE.md`, create `knowledge/<your-domain>/`, and update top-level `README.md`/`USAGE.md` to point to it.
